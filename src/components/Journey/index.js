            <p>
              Our entire life when we shop,we are limited by choices that are
              there in store. We are often on the site where we buy our
              fabourite coloured shoes made by someone else but what if we
              designed it? What if we could involve in the making of a shoe we
              want to buy? This little thought sprouted to become what we are
              today, KICKSUP! ;)

              Understanding the trends in the industry and what the users think
              when they buy were our top priorities before we moved further in
              the building.After weeks of fruitful research, we stepped into the
              user's shoes and look at what we plan to do. it's a great joy for
              users if they are involved in the making.We're heading into an era
              of technology and people prefer online shopping to shopping in an
              outlet.

              Every milestone begins with a single step and before KICKSUP
              sprouted, the team manufactured in small scale with two users a
              month. This experience was crucial to our brand as this is our
              firs practical experience.Interacting with users was the best
              thing ever. The positive reviews adn support from the people
              motivated us to push our limits further{" "}
